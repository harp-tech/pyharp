# harp-protocol

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/harp-protocol.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/harp-protocol)

The Harp Protocol is a binary communication protocol created in order to facilitate and unify the interaction between different devices. It was designed with efficiency and ease of parsing in mind.

For more detail please check the [official Harp Tech documentation](https://harp-tech.org/protocol/BinaryProtocol-8bit.html).

`harp-protocol` provides the building blocks: message framing and the typed register/payload DSL. Each register knows how to build (`format`) and decode (`parse`) its frames.

```python
import numpy as np
from harp.protocol import HarpMessage, RegisterU16

class WhoAmI(RegisterU16):
    address = 0

frame = WhoAmI.format(np.uint16(1216))           # build a Write frame
value = WhoAmI.parse(HarpMessage.parse(frame))   # -> np.uint16(1216)
```

## Register value types

`parse` returns numpy scalars rather than plain `int` or `float`, so a value carries the width its register declares. A Python `int` has no width and no upper bound, so it cannot distinguish a `U8` from a `U32`, nor detect a value leaving the register range.

```python
np.uint16(65535) + 1   # RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar add
65535 + 1              # 65536, wider than the register can hold
```

Numpy scalars behave like plain Python numbers in arithmetic, comparison and formatting. Use `int()` or `float()` where a built-in type is required.

## Reading an address no schema describes

A register class is normally declared with its address, as above, or generated from a `device.yml`. Calling a register base with an address instead builds a one-off register for that address, which is how a payload outside any schema is read and written:

```python
from harp.protocol import RegisterU8Array, RegisterU16

uid = RegisterU8Array(0x10, length=16)   # R_UID, named by no schema
tag = RegisterU8Array(0x11, length=16)   # R_TAG, the firmware git hash
version = RegisterU16(0x08)              # any address, as a scalar
```

The result is an ordinary register, so it goes through `read` and `write` on a device exactly as a declared one does. `length` is keyword-only for the array form, and it is the element count rather than a byte count. An already-addressed register rejects the call, so `WhoAmI(44)` raises rather than quietly producing a register at another address.

It carries no transport or device logic. See [`harp-device`](https://github.com/harp-tech/python/tree/main/src/packages/harp-device) for the device layer.
