"""Emit a Python module of register classes from a device schema.

A generated device package is already a module: register classes at module level
and a ``REGISTER_MAP`` beside them (see the ``harp-device`` README).
:func:`create_device_module` builds that same shape at runtime from a ``device.yml``, so a
schema-driven device and a generated one are reached the same way, by name from the
module or by address through ``REGISTER_MAP``.

    """Emit a module of register classes from ``device.yml`` text.

    The module names what the schema declares, its registers beside the enums and
    payload classes they are built from, so ``behavior.AnalogData``,
    ``behavior.AnalogDataPayload`` and ``behavior.EncoderModeMask`` all resolve while a
    common register such as ``WhoAmI`` is imported from :mod:`harp.device.core`, keeping
    one definition of each. This is the same set a generated device package holds. A
    name describing two declarations is rejected rather than shadowed. Beside them
    it holds:

    * ``REGISTER_MAP``, the device address space, so the common registers are
      present here even though the module does not name them;
    * ``WHO_AM_I``, the identity declared by the schema (``0`` for an unregistered device);
    * ``DEVICE_NAME``, the ``device`` name of the schema, or ``name`` when given, and
      empty for a header-less register fragment. Recordings are written under this
      name, so :class:`~harp.data.DatasetReader` matches files by it;
    * ``__name__``, the same name, falling back to ``"Device"`` so the module is never
      anonymous. This names the module rather than the device, and is not part of what
      a device module promises.

    Because the names come from the schema at runtime they don't autocomplete, and
    each resolves as ``Any`` rather than its own type. A generated device package is
    a real module on disk and gives both. On an address clash the device register
    replaces the common one in ``REGISTER_MAP``.

    ``text`` is the schema itself rather than a path to it, matching
    :func:`parse_device_schema`, so read the file first. The module is **not**
    registered in :data:`sys.modules`, so it cannot be reached by ``import`` and two
    schemas may share a name without clashing. Bind it yourself::
