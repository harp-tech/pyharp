    :func:`open_dataset` builds one for a folder that carries its own ``device.yml``.
    :attr:`contents` lists what was recorded, keyed by register name.

    ``device_module`` is a device module -- a generated device package, or one built from a
    schema with :func:`~harp.device.schema.create_device_module`. Its ``REGISTER_MAP`` is
    read at construction.

    The files are matched by a ``<DeviceName>`` prefix, taken from the ``DEVICE_NAME``
    declared by the module. Pass ``name`` to override it, or to supply one when the module
    declares an empty name.

    When the folder carries a ``device.yml`` and the module declares an identity, their
    ``whoAmI`` values are checked against each other. A module paired with the wrong
    folder then fails here rather than decoding the files against the wrong register
    map. ``validate`` turns off every check the reader performs, so a folder whose
    ``device.yml`` is damaged can be read with a module obtained elsewhere.

    The reader is typed on the module it was given, so registers stay reachable through
    :attr:`device_module` at whatever precision that module offers.

    File resolution defaults to the Harp file format: ``<name>_<address>.bin`` and,
    when a register was logged as several ``<name>_<address>_<suffix>.bin`` chunks,
    they are concatenated in filename order. Pass ``resolver`` (a :data:`FileResolver`)
    to support an alternative on-disk layout.
