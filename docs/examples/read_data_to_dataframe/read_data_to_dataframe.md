# Reading Data into a DataFrame

This example demonstrates how to load the binary data file of a **single** Harp register into a pandas DataFrame using `harp.data`. The register definition tells `parse_to_dataframe` how to decode each frame, so the result carries named columns and decoded enums.

!!! tip
    For a recorded session folder rather than one loose file, use [`open_dataset`](../read_dataset/read_dataset.md), which resolves each register against the device schema so any of them can be read by class, by name, or by address.
