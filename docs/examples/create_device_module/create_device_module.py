# `create_device_module` compiles a Harp `device.yml` into a module of register classes at
# runtime, with no code-generation step. This is the quickest way to work with a device
# that has no pre-generated package: point it at the schema and it produces the same
# structure a generated package has, registers at module level beside a
# `REGISTER_MAP`.

assert behavior.REGISTER_MAP[44] is AnalogData  # or by address

# Registers are ordinary register classes, so they work with `read` and `write` on
# any `Device` over a transport. Passing the module itself validates the device
# identity on open, against its `WHO_AM_I`, which a value of `0` skips.

# --- Custom interface types --------------------------------------------------
# A register with a custom `interfaceType` needs a converter so its field decodes
# to the right Python type. Pass it via `converters=`, keyed by "<Name>Converter":
#
#   behavior = schema.create_device_module(yml_text, converters={"DataConverter": DataConverter()})
#
# An unresolved custom type raises `UnknownConverterError`. Pass `strict=False` to
# decode it natively instead. `exclude_private=True`, the default, drops registers
# marked `private` in the schema. For the parsed schema model rather than a module,
# `parse_device_schema(yml_text)` returns that directly.
