# Reading a Whole Dataset Folder

A Harp acquisition is usually saved as a **de-multiplexed dataset folder**: one binary file per register, named `<DeviceName>_<address>.bin`, next to the `device.yml` schema for the device. `harp.data.DatasetReader` reads that whole folder into pandas DataFrames, based on a [device module](../../api/device.md) that describes how to decode each register.

This is the recommended entry point for a recorded session on disk. To decode a single loose `.bin` file instead, see [Reading Data into a DataFrame](../read_data_to_dataframe/read_data_to_dataframe.md).

The quickest way in is `open_dataset(folder)`. It finds the `device.yml` inside the folder, builds the device module, and returns a reader ready to go. Given a device module already in hand, for example from a pre-generated package, pass it as the second argument, `open_dataset(folder, module)`. A register is then read by class, by name, or by address. The Harp time becomes the `"Time"` index, as float seconds or an absolute `DatetimeIndex` when `time_index` is given a datetime.
